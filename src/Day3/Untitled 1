Java Methods 
A method is set of code which is refered to by name and can be called(invoked)at any point in a program
simply by utilizing method's name
-- a method as a subprogram that acts on data and often return a value
-- each method has its own name

Method --> Block of code
------------------------------
1)case1-- not taking parameters and also not returned any value
2)case2-- not taking parameters but returning value
3)case3-- taking parameters, but not returning any value
4)case4-- method is taking parameters and also returning a value. 

-- object is created only in main method
we can not create object outside the main() method

Constructor
---------------------------
1)Constructor is special type of method
2)Constructor used for initializing the class variables
3)Constructor name should be same as that of class name
4)Constructor will not return any value(not even void)
5)Constructor will be invoked at the time of object creation.

Types of constructor
--------------------------
1)Default constructor
2)Parameterized constructor

Q.what is the difference in methods v/s Constructor?

--> method
1) method name can be anything.
2)method can return a value.
3)need to call method explicitly.
4)it is used for writing logic

-->Constructor
1)Constructor name should be same as that of class name
2)Constructor does not return a value
3)Automatically invoked at the time of object creation.
4)Constructor is used for intializing the variables or values.
