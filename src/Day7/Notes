 how to handle the exception/handling exception
 -----------------------------------------------------
 
 Syntax1: 
 try
 {
 statements;
 }
 catch(Exception Type)   // try block is always followed by catch block
 {
 Statements;
 }
 
 --if we don't know what kind of exception is this then we have to put multiple catch blocks
 
 Syntax2: 
 try
 {
 statements;
 }
 catch(Exception Type1)   
 {
 Statements;
 }
 catch(Exception Type2)   
 {
 Statements;
 }
 catch(Exception Type3)   
 {
 Statements;
 }
 catch(Exception Type4)   
 {
 Statements;
 }
 
 
 Syntax3:
 try
 {
 to open a file
 }
 catch(Exception Type)
 {
 
 Statements
 }
 finally
 {
 close
 }
 
 one try block can have multiple catch blocks
 
 finally block is always executes...
 1) Exception doesn't occur.
 2) Exception occurs and not handled.
 3) Exception occurs and handled.
 
 Checked Exception can be handled in two ways
 --------------------------------------------------
 1) try..catch
 2) throws keyword
