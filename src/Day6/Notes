Interface
---------------
1) An interface in java is a bluprinrt of a class.
2) Interface contains final and static variables.
3) Interface contains abstract methods.
4) An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
5) Methods in interface are public by default.
6) Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
7) We can define interface with interface keyword
8) A class extends another class,an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface 
9) We can create object reference for interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
 -- 
 extends keyword is not extend more than one class that's why we use interface

java package
--------------------
-- package is collection of classes/interfaces/other files.
Q.how to create a subppackage?
--> Create 1st pack name and then 1st pack name.2nd pack name
e.g i.e pack1.pack2 

--Two Types of packages
1) User defined packages --created by us
2) Built-in packages
	 
Access Modifier's -- define the scope of variable and methods
------------------------------
1) Public -- we can access everywhere
2) Protected --the protected access modifier is accessible within package and outside the package but through inheritaance only
3) Default -- If you don't use any modifier,it is treated as default.
the default modifier is accessibleonly within package.
4) Private -- accesible in only within the class class
