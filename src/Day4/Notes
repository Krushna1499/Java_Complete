Day--4
--------
Overloading 
this keyword 
Static variables & static methods
------------------------------------

Overloading: creating methods with the same name with different parameters.
Advantage:
-----------
saves memory and save time
-----------------------
we create a same methods in class but when we call each method how can we differentiate these methods 
rules are
1)Number of parameters
2)data type of parameters
should be different in overloading

this keyword
static--> applicable for  variables and methods

static variables
static methods
---------------------
imp
1)static methods can access only static stuff(directly--without creating object)
means we don't need to create an object for printing the values
it shows directly the values and also we must have the static variable ,static method and static main 
then and then only it shows result/values/output 

2)static methods can also access non-static stuff but through object.
3) non static methods can access both static & non static stuff direct.

System.out.println()
------------------------------
class Test
{
static String s="welcome";
}
Test.s.length(); --- 7

class System
{
Static print Stream out;
}
System.out.Println("testing")
